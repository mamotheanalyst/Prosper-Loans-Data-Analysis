# Prosper-Loans-Data-Analysis
The dataset is from Prosper.com, a financial services company based in San Fransico. The company was founded in 2005 and is an online peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers, individual and institutional investors. Borrowers can apply for loans of up to $40 000.The dataset contains loan information for the company for the periods 2005 until 2014.

The main feaures of interest in the dataset are the following:

    BorrowerAPR
    LoanOriginalAmount
    BorrowerRate
    IncomeRange
    LoanTerm
    ListingCreationDate

# Relationships observed throughout the investigation

The relationships observed in this investigation were between Borrower Rate and Loan Amounts and between Income Range and Prosper Rating. It is evident that all incomes above $25 000 have a better Prosper Rating than those that earn beneath this income range and the unemployed which increases their chances of being given a loan. Another relationship was between interest rates for borrowing and orgiginal loan amounts. It is evident that smaller loan amounts attract higher interest rates than large loan amounts.

# Conclusions

From the analysis performed it is evident that the business has been performing well since inception in 2005. This is indicated by the rise in loans issued between 2006 and 2014 with the exception being 2009 and 2010 where there was a decline in loans because of the economic crisis of 2008. Of concern is the fact that the company has a negligent practice of issuing loans to unemployed customers and without verifying customer income which increases the company's risk exposure to customers not being able to pay back their loans.

The Borrower APR and Borrower Rate which can go upto 20% and 40% are very favourable to the lenders. The smaller loan amounts are more evenly distributed across all interest rates while it seems that the higher the loan amounts the less interest rate charged on the loans.

In order to grow the business the company needs to focus on growing it's client base in other states as a majority of loans issued were mainly issued in California which had double the number of loans as the next best performing state.
